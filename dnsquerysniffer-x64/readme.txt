Description
===========

DNSQuerySniffer is a network sniffer utility that shows the DNS queries
sent on your system. For every DNS query, the following information is
displayed: Host Name, Port Number, Query ID, Request Type (A, AAAA, NS,
MX, and so on), Request Time, Response Time, Duration, Response Code,
Number of records, and the content of the returned DNS records.
You can easily export the DNS queries information to
csv/tab-delimited/xml/html file, or copy the DNS queries to the
clipboard, and then paste them into Excel or other spreadsheet
application.



System Requirements
===================


* This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows
  2000, and up to Windows 10. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are
  supported.
* On some systems, capturing packets with the 'Raw Sockets' method may
  not work properly, and thus you'll need to install the WinPcap capture
  driver or the Network Monitor driver.
  Even if the 'Raw Sockets' method works properly on your system, it's
  recommended to install the WinPcap capture driver or Microsoft Network
  Monitor driver (version 3.4 or later) in order to get more accurate
  date/time information ('Request Time', 'Response Time', and 'Duration'
  columns)
* In order to use the Network Monitor driver on 64-bit systems, you
  have to download the x64 version of DNSQuerySniffer.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.81
  o Added 'Select All' and 'Deselect All' to the 'Column Settings'
    window.

  o Added support for GeoLite2 City and GeoLite2 Country database in
    CSV format (Both IPv4 and Ipv6 addresses are supported).
  o In order to use it, you have to extract the files of GeoLite2
    database into the folder of DNSQuerySniffer.exe

* Version 1.76
  o Added new Quick Filter option: 'Find records that match the
    specified host name wildcard (comma-delimited list)'. For example: if

Start Using DNSQuerySniffer
===========================

Except of a capture driver that you may need to install, DNSQuerySniffer
doesn't require any installation process or additional dll files. In
order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
DNSQuerySniffer.exe
After running DNSQuerySniffer in the first time, the 'Capture Options'
window appears on the screen, and you're requested to choose the capture
method and the desired network adapter. In the next time that you use
DNSQuerySniffer, it'll automatically start capturing packets with the
capture method and the network adapter that you previously selected. You
can always change the 'Capture Options' again by pressing F9.

After choosing the capture method and network adapter, DNSQuerySniffer
starts the displays the detail of every DNS query sent on your system.
You can press F6 to stop the DNS capture, F5 to start it again, or Ctrl+X
to clear the current DNS queries list.

You can select one or more DNS query lines, and then use the 'Save
Selected Items' option to export them into csv/tab-delimited/xml/html
file. You can also copy the selected DNS queries to the clipboard
(Ctrl+C) and then paste them (Ctrl+V) into Excel or other spreedsheet
application.

* Port Number: The client UDP port that was used to send the DNS query.
* Query ID: The ID of the query.
* Request Type: The type of the DNS request - A, AAAA, NS, MX, and so
  on...
* Request Time: The exact time that the DNS request was sent. The time
  is specified in absolute date/time or relative to the capture start,
  depending on what you choose in Options -> Time Display Mode.
  Be aware that this column displays more accurate result when using
  WinPcap driver or Microsoft Network Monitor driver, version 3.4 or
  later.
* Response Time: The exact time that the DNS response was received. The
  time is specified in absolute date/time or relative to the capture
  start, depending on what you choose in Options -> Time Display Mode.

  WinPcap driver or Microsoft Network Monitor driver, version 3.4 or
  later.
* Duration: The time difference in milliseconds between the Request
  Time and Response Time.
* Response Code: The returned response code. If the response code is
  not 'Ok', it means that the DNS server returned an error, and the
  bullet icon will be in red instead of green.

DNSQuerySniffer allows you to view country/city information for every IP
address found in the A records of the DNS response ('IP Country' column).
In order to activate this feature, you have to download one of the
following external files, and put the file in the same folder of
DNSQuerySniffer.exe:
* http://software77.net/geo-ip/: Download the IPv4 CSV file, extract it
  from the zip/gz file, and put it in the same folder of
  DNSQuerySniffer.exe as IpToCountry.csv
* GeoLite2 City database: Download the GeoLite2 City in CSV format and
  extract all files into the folder of DNSQuerySniffer.exe
  Be aware that the loading process of the GeoLite2 City database is
  quite slow.



Integration with IPNetInfo utility
==================================

If you want to get more information about the IP address displayed in the
DNS A record, you can use the Integration with IPNetInfo utility in order
to easily view the IP address information loaded directly from WHOIS
servers:
1. Download and run the latest version of IPNetInfo utility.
2. Select the desired items, and then choose "IPNetInfo - A Record"
   from the File menu (or simply click Ctrl+I).
3. IPNetInfo will retrieve the information about IP addresses of the
   selected items.



Command-Line Options
====================



/cfg <Filename>
Start DNSQuerySniffer with the specified configuration file. For example:
DNSQuerySniffer.exe /cfg "c:\config\dqs.cfg"
DNSQuerySniffer.exe /cfg "%AppData%\DNSQuerySniffer.cfg"



Translating DNSQuerySniffer to other languages
==============================================

In order to translate DNSQuerySniffer to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run DNSQuerySniffer with /savelangfile parameter:
   DNSQuerySniffer.exe /savelangfile
   A file named DNSQuerySniffer_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   DNSQuerySniffer utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run DNSQuerySniffer, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run DNSQuerySniffer without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
